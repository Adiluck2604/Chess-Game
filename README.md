# Two Player Chess game in Python using Pygame
Welcome to my chess game project built entirely in Python using Pygame!

1. Install Pygame: 
   pip install pygame
   
2. Clone the Repository:
   git clone https://github.com/sanika-14/python-chess-with-pygame
   cd chess-game-pygame
   
3. Run the Game:
   python main.py


I utilized Pygame to create the chessboard and pieces, implementing precise movement rules for each chess piece. Advanced features such as en passant, castling, and pawn promotion were integrated to enrich gameplay. Strategic check and checkmate detection mechanisms were also implemented to enhance the overall gaming experience.
Looking forward, as an ML enthusiast, my vision is to further enhance this project by integrating AI to create an intelligent chess opponent. This foundational work in Pygame lays a robust groundwork for future developments in AI and machine learning, promising exciting possibilities for the game's evolution and strategic depth.
