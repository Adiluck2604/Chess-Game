This is a two player python game, source code is give below;

Instructions:

Using Pygame, I created a fully functional chessboard and pieces, implementing precise movement rules for each type of chess piece. To enhance the gameplay experience, I integrated advanced features including en passant, castling, and pawn promotion. These additions bring depth and realism to the game, making it more engaging for players. Also, I implemented strategic mechanisms to detect check and checkmate scenarios, ensuring that the game accurately reflects critical moments in chess.
